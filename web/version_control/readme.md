### MIME type versioning

When you develop REST APIs you may want to add different versions of that API in future, say v1, v2 etc...,
and different users of our API should be able to call the desired version.

Now there can be different approaches to solve this API versioning problem like:

* URI Versioning,
* Parameter Versioning,
* Header Versioning or MIME versioning.
